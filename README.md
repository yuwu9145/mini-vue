# hand write mini-vue-core

The best way to learn Vue is by understading its source code and code it by yourself.

### Why this repo?
- It implements reactivity & render api against real test cases copied from Vue 3 Core source code
- It is a very simplied version of Vue 3 Core. The focus is on understanding the concept and ignores edge cases
- `playground.html` implements a very simple demo. It is amazing to see it works the same as Vue 3
